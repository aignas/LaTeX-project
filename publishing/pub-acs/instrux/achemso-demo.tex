\begin{abstract}
  This is an example document for the \textsf{achemso} document
  class, intended for submissions to the American Chemical Society
  for publication. The class is based on the standard \LaTeXe\
  \textsf{report} file, and does not seek to reproduce the appearance
  of a published paper.

  This is an abstract for the \textsf{achemso} document class
  demonstration document.  An abstract is only allowed for certain
  manuscript types.  The selection of \texttt{journal} and
  \texttt{type} will determine if an abstract is valid.  If not, the
  class will issue an appropriate error.

\section{Introduction}
This is a paragraph of text to fill the introduction of the
demonstration file.  The demonstration file attempts to show the
modifications of the standard \LaTeX\ macros that are implemented by
the \textsf{achemso} class.  These are mainly concerned with content,
as opposed to appearance.

\section{Results and discussion}

\subsection{Outline}

The document layout should follow the style of the journal concerned.
Where appropriate, sections and subsections should be added in the
normal way. If the class options are set correctly, warnings will be
given if these should not be present.

\subsection{References}

The class makes various changes to the way that references are
handled.  The class loads \textsf{natbib}, and also the appropriate
bibliography style.  References can be made using the normal method;
the citation should be placed before any punctuation, as the class
will move it if using a superscript citation style
\cite{Mena2000,Abernethy2003}. The use of \textsf{natbib} allows the
use of the various citation commands of that package:
\citeauthor{Abernethy2003} have shown something, or in
\citeyear{Cotton1999}.  Long lists of authors will be automatically
truncated in most article formats, but not in supplementary
information or reviews \cite{Pople2003}.

Multiple citations to be combined into a list can be given as
a single citation.  This uses the \textsf{mciteplus} package
\cite{Arduengo1992,*Eisenstein2005,*Arduengo1994}.  Citations
other than the first of the list should be indicated with a star.

The class also handles notes to be added to the bibliography.  These
should be given in place in the document \bibnote{This is a note.
The text will be moved the the references section.  The title of the
section will change to ``Notes and References''.}.  As with
citations, the text should be placed before punctuation.  A note is
also generated if a citation has an optional note.  This assumes that
the whole work has already been cited: odd numbering will result if
this is not the case \cite[p.~1]{Cotton1999}.

\subsection{Floats}

New float types are automatically set up by the class file.  The
means graphics are included as follows (\ref{sch:example}).  As
illustrated, the float is ``here'' if possible.
\begin{scheme}
  Your scheme graphic would go here: \texttt{.eps} format\\
  for \LaTeX\, or \texttt{.pdf} (or \texttt{.png}) for pdf\LaTeX\\
  \textsc{ChemDraw} files are best saved as \texttt{.eps} files;\\
  these can be scaled without loss of quality, and can be\\
  converted to \texttt{.pdf} files easily using \texttt{eps2pdf}.\\
  %\includegraphics{graphic}
  \caption{An example scheme}
  \label{sch:example}
\end{scheme}

\subsection{Math(s)}

The \textsf{achemso} class does not load any particular additional
support for mathematics.  If the author \emph{needs} things like
\textsf{amsmath}, they should be loaded in the preamble.  However,
the basics should work fine.  Some inline material $ y = mx + c$
followed by some display. \[ A = \pi r^2 \]

\section{Experimental}

The usual experimental details should appear here.  This could
include a table, which can be referenced as \ref{tbl:example}. Notice
that the caption is positioned at the top of the table. Do not worry
about the appearance of the table: this will be altered during
production.
\begin{table}
  \caption{An example table}
  \label{tbl:example}
  \begin{tabular}{ll}
    \hline
    Header one & Header two \\
    \hline
    Entry one & Entry two \\
    Entry three & Entry four \\
    Entry five & Entry five \\
    Entry seven & Entry eight \\
    \hline
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}

The example file also loads the \textsf{mhchem} package, so
that formulas are easy to input: \texttt{\textbackslash
ce\{H2SO4\}} gives \ce{H2SO4}.  See the use in the
bibliography file (when using titles in the references
section).

The use of new commands should be limited to simple things which will
not interfere with the production process.  For example,
\texttt{\textbackslash mycommand} has been defined in this example,
to give italic, monospaced text: \mycommand{some text}.

Thanks to Mats Dahlgren for version one of \textsf{achemso},
and Donald Arseneau for the code taken from \textsf{cite} to
move citations after punctuation.

\suppinfo

The entire \textsf{achemso} bundle is generated by running
\texttt{achemso.dtx} through \TeX. Running \LaTeX\ on the same file
will generate the general documentation for both the class and
package files.

%% The appropriate \bibliography command should be placed here.
