We have employed a short peptide that spontaneously self-assembles into a multimolecular fibrillar architecture to drive the coassembly of two independent luminescent moieties. We use fluorescence spectroscopy to demonstrate that the resulting complex performs a light-harvesting function.},

@article{Parsons2010,
abstract = {Compartmentalization is an important process, since it allows the segregation of metabolic activities and, in the era of synthetic biology, represents an important tool by which defined microenvironments can be created for specific metabolic functions. Indeed, some bacteria make specialized proteinaceous metabolic compartments called bacterial microcompartments (BMCs) or metabolosomes. Here we demonstrate that the shell of the metabolosome (representing an empty BMC) can be produced within E. coli cells by the coordinated expression of genes encoding structural proteins. A plethora of diverse structures can be generated by changing the expression profile of these genes, including the formation of large axial filaments that interfere with septation. Fusing GFP to PduC, PduD, or PduV, none of which are shell proteins, allows regiospecific targeting of the reporter group to the empty BMC. Live cell imaging provides unexpected evidence of filament-associated BMC movement within the cell in the presence of PduV.},

@article{Stott2009,
abstract = {A prominent surface loop links the first two beta strands of the lipoyl domain (E2plip) from the pyruvate dehydrogenase multienzyme complex of Escherichia coli. We show here that shortening this loop by two residues generates a protein that populates two structurally distinct stable conformers: an active, native-like monomer (HM) and a functionally compromised misfolded dimer (LM). Conversion of LM to HM was observed after exposure to temperatures above 50 degrees C. Removal of two additional residues from the loop caused the protein to adopt exclusively the misfolded conformation. Detailed NMR structural studies of the misfolded dimer reveal that the N-terminal half of the domain was unfolded and dynamic, whereas the C-terminal halves of two monomers had associated to form a structure with two-fold symmetry and a topology mimicking that of the folded monomer. The surface loop is therefore a hitherto unsuspected determinant in the folding process that leads to a functional protein.},

abstract = {Amyloid fibril formation is assumed to be the molecular basis for a variety of diseases of unrelated origin. Despite its fundamental clinical importance, the mechanism of amyloid formation is not fully understood. When we analyzed a variety of short functional fragments from unrelated amyloid-forming proteins, a remarkable occurrence of aromatic residues was observed. The finding of aromatic residues in diverse fragments raises the possibility that pi-pi interactions may play a significant role in the molecular recognition and self-assembly processes that lead to amyloid formation. This is in line with the well-known central role of pi-stacking interactions in self-assembly processes in the fields of chemistry and biochemistry. We speculate that the stacking interactions may provide energetic contribution as well as order and directionality in the self-assembly of amyloid structures. Experimental data regarding amyloid formation and inhibition by short peptide analogs also support our hypothesis. The pi-stacking hypothesis suggests a new approach to understanding the self-assembly mechanism that governs amyloid formation and indicates possible ways to control this process.},
