% \section{Introduction}
% A problem facing users of \btx{} is that there is no standard for
% formatting lists of references. Publishers and journals insist
% on completely arbitrary placement of commas, colons, and ordering of
% entries. Furthermore, author--year styles of citations are supported by
% certain special \LaTeX{} packages, but each for only a very limited
% number of bibliographic styles. Finally, most such style files are for
% English only, and any adaptations to other languages must duplicate the
% entire spectrum of such files.
%
% All of these obstacles are in principle easily overcome by simply
% reprogramming \btx{} by means of an appropriate \emph{bibliographic style
% file} (extension \texttt{.bst}). \btx{} is in fact extremely flexible;
% unfortunately its programming language is very low-level, permitting only
% the most basic of hacks for the normal user.
%
% The solution to this is a \emph{generic} or \emph{master bibliographic
% style file} (extension \texttt{.mbs}) containing \dtx{} options for
% alternative coding. By selecting the desired options, one can customize a
% \texttt{.bst} file to one's needs.
%
% This file, \texttt{\filename}, is my latest version of a general-purpose
% \texttt{.mbs} file to meet as many bibliographic needs as possible.
% It was originally assembled from Oren Patashnik's standard files {\tt
% plain.bst} and \texttt{unsrt.bst}, plus his non-standard file {\tt
% apalike.bst}, a very basic author--year citation style.
% It has since evolved extensively as I have added features found in
% available \texttt{.bst} files, and those demanded by publishers or
% suggested to me by many user/contributors.
%
% To produce a customized bibliographic style (\texttt{.bst}) file from this
% master file, simply \TeX{} or \LaTeX{} the `program' \texttt{makebst.tex}.
% When asked for the name of the master file, answer with
% \begin{quote}\tt\filename\end{quote}
% and then reply to the questions in the following menus. The last question
% is whether you want to generate the \texttt{.bst} file right away.
%
% More details on this process and on the options available are to be found
% in the rest of this article.
%
% \section{History of this File}
%
% Since the first release of this generic file, in November 1993, under the
% name \texttt{genbst.mbs}, I have received innumerable
% suggestions for additions, most of which I have tried to include. Often
% this has resulted in reorganizing the coding, and adding new functions.
% The resulting \texttt{.bst} files are now quite different from those of
% Patashnik, although the underlying ideas are the same.
%
% A second version was released shortly afterwards that paralleled the first
% one except that it included support for languages other than English.
% That file was named \texttt{babel.mbs}, following the \texttt{babel}
% system of Johannes Braams. Although I always viewed it as version 2 of
% \texttt{genbst.mbs}, all additions to the one were also included in the
% other. This of course was tedious and prone to error. I looked forward to
% the day when \texttt{babel.mbs} would become the only supported version.
% The reason I was reluctant to do that before was that the overhead per
% language was fairly high, and I dreaded to think how large the file would
% become when 20 or 30 languages were added.
%
% I then found a way to put the language definitions into separate files,
% one per language. This means that new languages do not burden the basic
% file, and that users need only keep those support files that might
% interest him or her. New ones may also be made up locally by hacking an
% existing language definition file. (The file \texttt{english.mbs} is
% supplied only for this purpose.)
%
% For this reason, \texttt{\filename} was released as version~3 of
% \texttt{genbst.mbs} and \texttt{babel.mbs}. In spite of the new name, it
% should be regarded as their direct successor. Needless to say, this means
% that the earlier two \texttt{.mbs} files will no longer be maintained.
%
% To include language support, all explicit English words like
% \textsl{editor} and \textsl{chapter} have been replaced by functions
% whose definitions may be altered in the resulting \texttt{.bst} file
% (less desirable method) or which may be redefined by an external
% language definition file (preferred method).  Alternatively, one can select
% the pseudo-language named \texttt{babel} which inserts \LaTeX{} commands
% for the explicit words, the definitions of which must be
% contained in a file called {\tt babelbst.tex}. Only the languages English
% and \texttt{babel} are included internally to \texttt{\filename}; all
% others are contained in external language definition files.
%
% Another new feature is the possibility of including a file containing
% prestored shorthand designations for certain journal names. Such a file
% is provided for physics journals, but others could be made up using this
% one as a model. See Section~\ref{sec:jnames}.
%
% To take advantage of these external files, one must use
% \texttt{makebst} version~3; \texttt{\filename} may still be used with
% earlier versions, but without the external files.
%
% Version~4 arose out of a project by David Carlisle who created a variant
% of \texttt{\filename} for REV\TeX\ and the American Physical Society with
% the help of Mark Doyle of the APS. The main purpose was to add extra
% fields (see page~\pageref{sec:revtex}) that were needed. Subsequently
% Arthur Ogawa revised the code considerably, making it more rational,
% fixing some bugs and adding some extra features.
%
% I was then asked to incorporate all these changes into the official
% version of \texttt{\filename}. This required much debugging, since the
% Ogawa's rationalization upset several of the delicate interplays between
% various options. The result is version~4.0, the work on which has been
% supported by the American Physical Society.
%
% Version~4.0 contains the REV\TeX\ extra fields and the
% Carlisle-Doyle-Ogawa rewrites. An additional feature that derived from
% Carlisle's work on REV\TeX\ is the tagging of the text entries in the
% bibliography. This means the volume number is given as
% |\bibinfo{volume}{5}|. Normally only the number 5 is printed, but another
% program could use this to reconstruct the original database entries.
%
% Arthur Ogawa also added some features to \texttt{makebst} to provide a more
% verbose protocol. As a result, version~4 of \texttt{\filename} can only be
% used with version~4 of \texttt{makebst}. Older versions of \texttt{\filename}
% will still function with the newer \texttt{makebst}. Also, \texttt{.dbj}
% files created with older versions should still produce the same results with
% \texttt{\filename}~4.

% much to hope that all bibliographic wishes will be fulfilled quickly and
% easily, but we shall try as best we can. Watch the wizardry at work!

%
% \section{About Master Bibliographic Style Files}
%
% For details about how master bibliography style files are to be
% constructed, see the documentation on \texttt{makebst}. Here only a
% rough overview is given.
%
% \subsection{The \dtx{} Program}
% The \dtx{} program, written by Frank Mittelbach, is now a fundamental
% part of the \LaTeXe{} installation. Its original purpose is to remove
% comment lines from documented files, but has the secondary function of
% selecting alternative lines of coding.
%
% A master \btx{} bibliographic style file is one that, when processed by
% \dtx{} with selected options, produces a regular \btx{} \texttt{.bst}
% file with the desired features.
%
% In this sense, \dtx{} functions something like a C preprocessor. In fact,
% Oren Patashnik's original \texttt{.bst} files were all produced from a single
% source file by means of the preprocessor. The advantage of \dtx{} is that
% it is portable to all installations with \TeX.
%
% \subsection{The \dtx{} Batch Job}
%
% The \dtx{} program can be run either interactively, where the user must
% answer questions via the keyboard, or by means of a batch job where all
% the inputs are prepared in a file beforehand. For producing a \btx{}
% style file from a master file, the batch job method is the only feasible
% one, simply because of the large number of options available. (There is
% another reason for employing a batch job: the interactive method adds an
% |\endinput| command at the end, something that \btx{} will protest
% about.)
%
% The batch job files in general do not have any particular extension but I
% use \texttt{.dbj} for \emph{\dtx{} batch job}. These files are useful
% because they document the options used to produce the \texttt{.bst} file,
% and they may be edited to experiment with alternative options.
%
% \subsection{The \texttt{makebst} Program}
%
% It is possible to make up a batch job file by hand using the option
% information listed in Section~\ref{sec:options}, but my accompanying
% program \texttt{makebst} simplifies the task considerably. It reads menu
% information in the master file itself in order to present the user with
% an interactive list of choices, translating the answers into appropriate
% options that are then written to a batch job file.
%
% To run it, simply process \texttt{makebst.tex} with \TeX\ or \LaTeX, and
% answer the questions. The first of these is whether you want some
% instructions or not, and the second is the name of the \texttt{.mbs} that
% you want to use. The next query is about the name of the desired
% \texttt{.bst} file (which will also be the root name of the batch job).
% After that, all further questions come from menu information in the
% master file.
%
% At the very end, \texttt{makebst} asks if it should run the batch job for
% you. Isn't that a fine service?
%
% \section{Multilingual Adaptation}
% The original \texttt{.bst} files from Oren Patashnik contain explicit
% English words that are output into the final text. Since \LaTeX{} is
% increasingly being used for other languages, and since the official
% version since December 1991 also uses macros in place of explicit words,
% it seems appropriate for \btx{} to follow suit.
%
% In this master bibliographic style file {\tt\filename}, all explicit
% words have been replaced by functions: e.g., the word \textsl{editor} has
% become the function \texttt{bbl.editor}. Depending on the language option
% chosen, this function is defined to be the text {\tt"editor"},
% {\tt"Redakteur"}, or {\tt"redacteur"}, for English, German, and French,
% respectively.
%
% There is another special `language' called \texttt{babel} that instead inserts
% the text |"\bbleditor{}"|; the definitions of these \LaTeX{} commands
% must be in a separate file named \texttt{babelbst.tex} that is read in at
% the start of the bibliography.
%
% Only English and \texttt{babel} are supported directly in
% \texttt{\filename}; all other language definitions are contained in
% separate definition files, e.g., \texttt{french.mbs}, \texttt{german.mbs}.
%
% The language selection is made during the \texttt{makebst} run, which
% asks for the name of the language definition file as the first menu item. If
% either English or \texttt{babel} is wanted, reply with the default, which
% is \texttt{\filename} itself; otherwise give the name of the desired
% language file.
%
% \begin{quote}\slshape
%   \textbf{Note:} the language definition files can only be used with
%   \texttt{makebst} version~3 or later, and
%
%   with an external definition file, the \dtx{} run requires two passes
%   through \texttt{\filename}, doubling the processing time.
% \end{quote}
%
% Apart from the language adaptation of the whole bibliography, there is also
% the possibility of switching languages for individual references, so as to
% hyphenate the title properly. This is done with the \texttt{language} field
% and the \verb!\setlanguage! command.
%
% \subsection{Adding a New Language Definition File}
%
% To create a new language definition file, simply take one of the existing
% ones, like \texttt{english.mbs}, and replace the explicit English words
% with their translations. There are, however, a number of points that can
% complicate this procedure.
%
% \begin{enumerate}
% \item
%   Do not forget to change the documentation in the file, especially
%   version number, date, author.
%
% \item
%   There are option menus that need to be translated too. It might also be
%   desirable to add or remove options. In most cases, the options in the
%   language files involve possible abbreviations, like
%   \begin{quote}
%      \verb!\mes{^^JABBREVIATE WORD `PAGES':}!\\
%      \verb!\optdef{*}{}{`Page(s)'}{(no abbreviation)}!\\
%      \verb!\optdef{a}{pp}{`Page' abbreviated}{as p. or pp.}!\\
%      \verb!\getans!
%   \end{quote}
%
%   In this example, the option \texttt{pp} appears later in the definition
%   \begin{quote}
%      \verb!FUNCTION {bbl.pages}!\\
%      \verb+%<!pp>{ "pages" }+\\
%      \verb!%<pp>{ "pp." }!
%   \end{quote}
%   This a \emph{local} option, that only affects the coding in the definition
%   file. It is possible to add more local options.
%
% \item
%   However, all options, whether activated by the main file or by the
%   definition file, apply to both. In other words, there really is no such
%   thing as a local option. In the above example, \texttt{pp} is only
%   local because it is never used in \texttt{\filename}.
%
% \item
%   Add the name of the language as an option, with
%   \begin{quote}
%      \verb!\mes{^^JOptions for ENGLISH}!\\
%      \verb!\wr{\spsp\spsp english,\pc: English language}!
%   \end{quote}
%   (This is how options are added without |\optdef| and |\getans|.) The
%   main file just might recognize it in order to take some
%   language-specific action. The least it should do is add a comment at
%   the start of the \texttt{.bst} file stating for which language it is to
%   be used.
%
% \item
%   There could be some problems with edition numbers due to language
%   dependent ways of treating ordinal numbers (1st, 2nd, 3rd in English;
%   1$^{\mbox{\scriptsize re}}$, 2$^{\mbox{\scriptsize e}}$,
%   3$^{\mbox{\scriptsize e}}$ in French; 1., 2., 3., in German). Some
%   accommodation already exists for the oddball language English, and
%   further hacking may be needed for others.
%
% \item
%   If there should be any need for a double-quote character in
%   the translations (German needs it for umlauts) then there is trouble
%   because the \btx{} strings do not allow it. Instead, use the command
%   |\qq|, as in the German word |F\qq{u}nfte| for {\sl F\"unfte} (fifth).
%   It is then vital to add the option \texttt{umlaut} with
%   \begin{quote}
%      \verb!\wr{\spsp\spsp umlaut,\pc: Activate umlaut command}!
%   \end{quote}
%
% Bernd Raichle points out that |\^^b| can be used in place of |\"|
% within \btx{} code. One can thus replace |F\qq{u}nfte| with |F\^^b unfte|
% and do away with the \texttt{umlaut} option.
%
% \end{enumerate}
%
% \subsection{Changing \texttt{babelbst.tex} for a New Language}
%
% Alternatively, a new language can be added by
% modifying the file \texttt{babelbst.tex} and selecting the language {\tt
% babel} for the \texttt{.bst} file. If this is the only language to be used,
% then just change the English words in the definitions.
%
% However, some form of switching would be more desirable. With \TeX\
% version 3, there is a |\language| parameter to control the hyphenation
% patterns, and this could be used to select the correct language. For
% example, if language 0 is English and language 1 German, then put the
% English version of \texttt{babelbst.tex} into \texttt{englbst.tex} and the
% German
% version in \texttt{germbst.tex}. Then \texttt{babelbst.tex} could contain:
% \begin{quote}\begin{verbatim}
% \ifcase\language \input{englbst} \or \input{germbst}
%   \else \input{englbst} \fi
% \end{verbatim}
% \end{quote}
%
% This is of course installation dependent.
%
% \subsection{Extracting the Sample \texttt{babelbst.tex} File}
%
% A sample \texttt{babelbst.tex} (for English) is contained in this master
% file.  Extract it with \dtx{} and the option \texttt{bblbst}. It may be
% edited (and possibly renamed) for other languages as needed.
%
% \subsection{Problem with Edition Numbers}
% Something to note here is the ordinal numbers for editions. \btx{}
% demands that the field \texttt{edition} be given in the database as a word
% \textsl{First}, \textsl{Second}, etc., or as \textsl{1st}, \textsl{2nd},
% etc. This is bad policy
% because it is language dependent. So what I do is to test for the words
% \textsl{first} through \textsl{fifth} (case independently) and replace them
% with language-dependent equivalents. If the {\tt<ord>} option is selected,
% these equivalents are ordinal numbers for that language. Any other words
% cannot be interpreted and must be printed as is.
%
% However, if the \texttt{edition} is given as a number, with or without
% following letters, then the numbers 1 through 5 are replaced by their
% words; any higher numbers just have the ordinal ending (\textsl{th}
% in English) added to them.
%
% These numbers are only used with the word \textsl{edition} or
% its equivalent in other languages, so the translators need
% to provide only the one gender, e.g., feminine for both German and
% French.
%
%
% \section{Prestoring Names of Journals}\label{sec:jnames}
%
% The standard \texttt{.bst} files contain the names of some 20 journals
% in the field of computing, stored as macros for easy reference within the
% database \texttt{.bib} files. For example, the \textsl{Journal of
% Computer and System Sciences} can be referred to as \texttt{jcss}.
% With the option \texttt{jabr} (for journal abbreviation) this same
% shorthand produces \textsl{J.~Comput. Syst. Sci.}.
%
% Some \texttt{.bst} files for physics journals include additional journal
% names, and it is conceivable that other faculties might wish to prepare
% their own such lists, with each name present in a full or abbreviated
% form. Such an external file can now be added with \texttt{\filename} and
% \texttt{makebst} version~3.
%
% As a model, I supply a file \texttt{physjour.mbs} with the names of
% physics journals which I have taken from other \texttt{.bst} files.
% I also have a file \texttt{geojour.mbs} with the names of geophysics
% journals, and a contributed file \texttt{photjour.mbs} containing names of
% optics journals.
%
% In fact, version~3.5 can even include multiple journal-name files.
% Thus one can decide whether to include both, one, or none of the above
% files.
%
% \section{HTML Output}
% There is an option \texttt{html} to create a \texttt{.bst} file producing
% hypertext (HTML) output instead of the regular \LaTeX\ code. This is still
% experimental. The resulting \btx\ output will still be a file with extension
% \texttt{.bbl} and will contain the \LaTeX\ special characters, like |\"a| for
% \"a. One must go over the output to convert such characters to the HTML
% equivalents, and to remove curly braces. Only then can it be renamed
% \texttt{.html}.
%
% Three possible lists are offered:
% \begin{itemize}
% \item a simple paragraph for each entry,
% \item a numbered list,
% \item a description list with the key as the label.
% \end{itemize}
%
% \section{Updating Older \texttt{.dbj} Files}\label{sec:update}
% If you have existing \texttt{.dbj} files for generating \texttt{.bst}
% files from the older version \texttt{genbst.mbs}, these may be run with
% \texttt{\filename} by simply changing the name of the source
% \texttt{.mbs} file. For example, where the older \texttt{.dbj} file contains
% the line
% \begin{quote}
% |\generateFile{mystyle.bst}{f}{\from{genbst.mbs}{%|
% \end{quote}
% edit the file so that \texttt{genbst.mbs} is replaced by
% \texttt{\filename}. The resulting \texttt{mystyle.bst} file will then be
% an updated version of the older one, containing all the same features.
%
% Version~4 of \texttt{\filename} can only be used with version~4 of
% \texttt{makebst}, whereas older versions of \texttt{\filename} will still
% function with the newer \texttt{makebst}. Also, \texttt{.dbj} files created
% with older versions should still produce the same results with
% \texttt{\filename}~4, albeit with different coding.
%
% \section{Acknowledgements}
% I wish to thank all the people who have taken the trouble to send me
% suggestions or special requests. Admittedly, it has been out of
% self-interest on their part, since they had bibliographic needs to be
% met. And I have often questioned the need for many of their demands. Yet,
% that is part of the bibliographic jungle that I am trying to eliminate.
% If I thought that bibliographies were arbitrarily formatted before I
% started this project, I have more than sufficient confirmation since
% then. The fault lies not with the poor contributors, but with the
% publishers who cannot agree on a decent standard.
%
% I want to thank Frank Mittelbach, not only for creating \dtx{}
% in the first place, but also for sending me his bibliographic requirements,
% and for suggesting an improvement to \texttt{makebst}.
%
% David Carlisle has added the REV\TeX\ fields and |\bibinfo| tagging in a
% special variant of \texttt{\filename}; Arthur Ogawa then incorporated
% them into the main file, and overhauled much of the coding to make it
% more legible and rational.
%
% I especially wish to thank Mark Doyle and the American Physical
% Society for supporting the work on \texttt{custom-bib}~4.0.
%
% And finally, all of us must thank Oren Patashnik for providing \btx;
% without its flexibility and programmability (in spite of the complexity
% of the language) the master bibliographic styles would not be possible at
% all.
%
% \section{The Options}\label{sec:options}
% Here I present a list of all the \dtx{} options that are
% available in this file {\tt\filename}.
% The normal user can skip this section since he will probably make use
% of the menus via \texttt{makebst}. These are described in
% Section~\ref{sec:menu}. The menus provide much more informative prompts
% than the heavily abbreviated option names listed here. In other words,
% the options described in this section are meant for internal (programmer)
% usage, while the normal interface for the user is the menus.
%
% I have tried to avoid
% conflicts with mutually exclusive options by always letting one dominate if
% more than one has been specified. Such options have the same prefix, such
% as \texttt{nm-rev} and \texttt{nm-init}.
% If one uses \texttt{makebst} to produce the
% \dtx{} batch job, then it is impossible to give mutually
% exclusive options unless one edits the batch file oneself afterwards.
% (Anything is possible with computer freaks!)
%
% Most mutually exclusive options have the same prefix before the hyphen.
%
% \newenvironment{opt}{%
% \begin{list}{}{\labelwidth2cm \leftmargin2.5cm \labelsep1em \rightmargin0pt
%  \def\makelabel##1{\ttfamily##1 \hfill}}}{\end{list}}
% \textbf{Citation style:} whether or not a numerical or author--year system
% is to be used.
% \begin{opt}
% \item[--] default is numerical, standard \LaTeX, as for {\tt
%           plain.bst}.\\
%           |\bibitem{key}...|
% \item[cite] special for listing entire databases; the cite key is used
%             as the label so it may be listed.\\
%             |\bibitem[key]{key}...|
% \item[ay] for author--year style of citations. Various forms of |\bibitem|
%           are provided under this option, to support different types
%           of \LaTeX{} styles for interfacing with the author--year system.
% \item[alph] for \texttt{alpha.bst} style of citations; essentially numerical
%           but an abbreviation of the author names plus year is used as
%           the label. First three letters of single author, or first letters
%           of first three authors.
% \item[alf-1] with \texttt{alph}, uses first three letters of first author's
%           name, regardless of how many authors.
% \item[alf-f] with \texttt{alph}, uses first author's whole name.
% \end{opt}
%
% For numerical style, one can select the HTML option, to output a
% hypertext file instead of a \LaTeX\ one.
%
% \begin{opt}
% \item[--] normal \LaTeX\ output;
% \item[html] for HTML output, one reference per paragraph
% \item[htlist] (with \texttt{html}) outputs to a numbered list;
% \item[htdes] (with \texttt{html}) outputs description list, with the key.
% \end{opt}
%
% If \texttt{ay} has been selected, then the type of author--year interface
% is selectable. Some of these, like \texttt{natbib} and \texttt{harvard}
% exist in two versions because of updates in these systems.
% \begin{opt}
% \item[--] default is the system I invented for my \texttt{natbib.sty}.\\
%            |\bibitem[author(year)]{key}...|
% \item[nat] for extended format of \texttt{natbib.sty} version 5.3\\
%            |\bibitem[author(year)full author]{key}...|
% \item[alk] for the \texttt{apalike.sty} of Oren Patashnik and related
%            systems\\
%            |\bibitem[author, year]{key}...|
% \item[har] for the Harvard family of styles (with \texttt{harvard.sty}).\\
%            |\harvarditem[short]{long}{year}{key}...|
% \item[harnm] for the extended Harvard family, containing some extra commands
%            used by \LaTeXe\ version 2.0.3 of \texttt{harvard.sty}
% \item[ast] for astronomy family of styles (with \texttt{astron.sty}).\\
%            |\bibitem[\protect\astroncite{author}{year}]{key}...|
% \item[cay] for the Chicago family of styles (with \texttt{chicago.sty}).\\
%            |\bibitem[\protect\citeauthoryear{long}{short}{year}]{key}...|
% \item[nmd] for the `named' variant of Chicago (with \texttt{named.sty}).\\
%            |\bibitem[\protect\citeauthoryear{author}{year}]{key}...|
% \item[cn] for the ``author--date'' group of styles (with {\tt
%            authordate1-4.sty})\\
%            |\bibitem[\protect\citename{author, }year]{key}...|
% \end{opt}
%
% \textbf{Sequence:} the order in which the references are listed.
% \begin{opt}
% \item[--]      default is alphabetical by all authors, date, title
% \item[seq-yr]  order by year (ascending), authors, title
% \item[seq-yrr]  order by year (descending), authors, title
% \item[seq-no]  sequence by citation order
% \item[seq-lab] (author--year) by label, date, title (means that Daly
%                precedes Daly and Williams, precedes Daly et al.)
% \item[seq-key] (author--year) like \texttt{seq-lab} except that for
%                identical authors and year, the cite keyword is used
%                instead of the title
% \item[vonx]    ignore \emph{von} part of name when ordering (default is
%                to consider \emph{von} as part of the whole surname)
% \end{opt}
%
% \textbf{Language selection:} the translations of certain explicit words.
% \begin{opt}
% \item[--]      default is English, for \textsl{and}, \textsl{chapter},
%                  \textsl{editor}, etc.;
% \item[babel]     replace words with \LaTeX{} commands that are defined
%                  in the file \texttt{babelbst.tex};
% \item[lang]     adds the \texttt{language} field for switching language
%                 for one reference only by means of the \verb!\setlanguage!
%                 command in \texttt{babel}.
% \end{opt}
%
% If one of the external language definition files is used, then the name of
% its language should be in the list of active options. Many other language
% names are already included as options in this main file simply for the
% purpose of adding a comment at the start of the \texttt{.bst} file.
%
% The \texttt{language} field is intended to allow the hyphenation patterns
% to be switched temporarily so that titles can be set in the original
% language.
%
% \textbf{Annotation:}
% annotations are added either by means of the \texttt{annote} field, or
% with a \texttt{.tex} file of the same name as the citation key.
% \begin{opt}
% \item[--]   no annotations
% \item[annote] annotations enabled, with \texttt{annote} field.
% \end{opt}
%
% \textbf{Missing names:}
% If the author and/or editor is missing, the standard \texttt{.bst} files
% use the \texttt{key} field in place of the names for purposes of ordering the
% entries.
%
% For author--year styles, the \texttt{key} field is even inserted in the
% reference list and in the label in place of the authors. Optionally, one can
% suppress the year in this case, which causes \texttt{natbib} (version~7)
% to print only that key text as a code designation for the work.
%
% \begin{opt}
% \item[--] year is inserted in the labels when \texttt{key} replaces authors
% \item[keyxyr] year is left blank in this case
% \end{opt}
%
% \textbf{Names formatting:} how initials and surnames are to be combined.
% \begin{opt}
% \item[--]       default is full names, given names first
% \item[nm-revf]  full names, surname first
% \item[nm-init]  initials plus surname
% \item[nm-rev]   surname plus initials
% \item[nm-rev1]  surname plus initials (1st name only) then initials
%                 plus surname
% \item[nm-revv1] same as \texttt{nm-rev1} but with full names
% \item[nm-rv]    as \texttt{nm-rev}, but initials without dots
% \item[nm-rvvc]  as \texttt{nm-rev}, but initials without spaces
% \item[nm-rvv]   as \texttt{nm-rev}, but initials without spaces or comma
% \item[nm-rvx]   as \texttt{nm-rev}, but initials without dots or spaces
% \item[nm-rvcx]  as \texttt{nm-rvx}, but with comma after surname
% \item[ed-rev]   editors' names in collections are reversed the same as authors'
% \item[ed-au]    editors are formatted with same routine as authors; this
%                 is an alias for \texttt{ed-rev}, which is kept only for
%                 compatibility
% \item[aunm-semi] a semi-colon is placed between author names instead of
%                  a comma
% \item[aunm-sl]  a slash is placed between author names instead of a comma
% \item[nmdash]   repeated author/editor names replaced by dash
% \item[nmd-2]    with \texttt{nmdash}, uses 2 em dashes
% \item[nmd-3]    with \texttt{nmdash}, uses 3 em dashes
% \item[jnrlab]   include the junior part of name in citations (normally
%                 appears only in reference listing)
% \item[jnrlst]   with one of the \texttt{nm-rev} type options, puts the
%                 junior part last, after the (reversed) first name
% \end{opt}
%
% \textbf{Number of names:} normally all names listed (in reference list)
% \begin{opt}
% \item[nmlm]     limit number of names
% \item[x1...x90]  (with \texttt{nmlm}) maximum number of names to appear;
%                  for over 9, give the tens and units separately, as
%                  \texttt{x20,x5} for 25
% \item[m1...m90]  (with \texttt{nmlm}) minimum number before \textsl{et al.}
%                   written;
%                 no check for consistency is taken; one \texttt{x} and
%                 one \texttt{m} number must be given, and {\tt x}$\le${\tt m}
% \end{opt}
%
% \textbf{Names font:} in the reference list
% \begin{opt}
% \item[--]       default is names in normal typeface
% \item[nmft]     names are in some special font
% \item[nmfted]   editors' names in collections also get special fonts
% \item[nmft-sc]  names in small caps
% \item[nmft-it]  names in italics

% \textbf{Number and series:} for collections and inproceedings
%
% This is a confusing issue. The standard wants to print something like
% ``number 123 in Collected Works'', and issues a warning if there is a number
% without a series. However, for many such works, there is an identification
% number for the collection, such as ESA~SP-123. Giving this as the number
% without a series results in ``number ESA~SP-123'' and a warning. Setting the
% series to this code number produces desired results, but is illogical.
%
% Another problem is that this code number should often should appear just
% before the publisher name,
% whereas the standard places it elsewhere.
%
% \begin{opt}
% \item[--]  default, number must have series, \textsl{number} is printed
% \item[num-xser] default behaviour if both number and series present, but if
%      only number is there, it is printed without the word \textsl{number} and

% \item[ser-vol] for a book in a series with volume number, appears as ``\textit{Series-Name}, vol.~23''
%       rather than ``vol.~23 of \textit{Series-Name}''

% \section{The Menu Information}\label{sec:menu}
% Here I describe the options and menu information for this particular
% master file \texttt{\filename}. To construct a \dtx{} driver file
% to generate a desired \texttt{.bst} file, simply process \texttt{makebst.tex}
% with \TeX\ or \LaTeX, and give
% \begin{quote}\tt\filename\end{quote}
% when prompted for the name of the master file. Then answer the questions
% in the menus that follow. The menu information is extracted from here.
%
% All the menu information is nested between \dtx{} guard options
% |%<*options>| \dots\ |%</options>|, and the last command is
% |\endoptions|. The rest of the file is nested between
% \begin{quote}
%   |%<*!options&!driver&!bblbst>| \dots\ |</!options&!driver&!bblbst>|
% \end{quote}
% in order to exclude it if \dtx{} is used to
% extract the menu information, the documentation driver, or the
% \texttt{babelbst.tex} file.
%
% The main coding is divided into two sections, the \emph{head} and
% \emph{tail}; in between come any external language or journal name
% support files. The head part is marked with the \dtx{} guard option
% |<!tail>| and the tail with |<!head>|. This roundabout means of doing
% things makes it possible to process \texttt{\filename} with \texttt{.dbj}
% files that were generated for the older \texttt{genbst.mbs} file by
% simply changing the name of the source file as shown in
% Section~\ref{sec:update}. If both \texttt{head} and \texttt{tail} (and
% \texttt{exlang}) options are omitted, as they are in the older
% \texttt{.dbj} files, \texttt{\filename} is processed completely in one
% pass. To include external files, two passes are needed, one for each
% part, with the external file(s) coming in between.
%
% Note too that if the internal language commands are taken (i.e., if
% \texttt{exlang} option is not given) then the default language is
% English, which is tested for as |<!babel>|. This too permits the simple
% update of older \texttt{.dbj}, at least for English.
%
% \subsection*{Selecting Language}
% Explicit words in the bibliography style, such as \textsl{and},
%      \textsl{editor}, etc.,
% are represented by functions \texttt{bbl.and}, \texttt{bbl.editor}, and so on.
% By default these functions translate to the normal English text, but
% other languages are also possible.
%
% The definitions of these functions for other languages are contained in
% external files. At this point, we can make use of features in
% \texttt{makebst} (version~3.0 or later) to ask for the name of such a
% definition file, and store it in |\cfile|. If no external file is
% specified, then the internal definitions are taken, for which there are
% two possibilities: English or \LaTeX{} commands (Babel).
%
% The commands |\MBswitch|, |\mes|, |\MBaskfile|, |\wr|, |\pc|, |\spsp| are
% defined in \texttt{makebst.tex}.
%
% If |\MBswitch| does not exist, then the version of \texttt{makebst}
% cannot support external files.

% |\bibitem[Daly et al.(1990)]{key}...|
% \end{quote}
% There is now a newer version of \texttt{natbib.sty} (v5.3) that
% supports an optional full author list too, as
% \begin{quote}
% |\bibitem[Daly et al.(1990)Daly, Keppler, and Williams]{key}...|
% \end{quote}
% Other systems are also supported, such as the Harvard family of
% bibliography styles (with \texttt{harvard.sty}), which have entries in the
% form
% \begin{quote}
% |\harvarditem[Daly et al.]{Daly, Keppler,|\\
% |       and Williams}{1990}{key}...|
% \end{quote}
% or the astronomy family (with \texttt{astron.sty}) with entries like

% \end{quote}
% or the Chicago family (with \texttt{chicago.sty}) with entries like

% |\bibitem[\protect\citeautheryear{Daly, Keppler, and|\\
% |      Williams}{Daly et al.}{1990}]{key}...|
% \end{quote}

% or the so-called ``author--date'' group (with \texttt{authordate1-4.sty})
% with entries of the form
% \begin{quote}
% |\bibitem[\protect\citename{Daly et al.}1990]{key}...|
% \end{quote}
% Finally, there is the \texttt{apalike} format of Oren Patashnik, for use

%
% \subsection*{Ordering of the listed references}
%   Choices here depend on citation style. The default in both cases is
% alphabetical order of all authors. For numerical style, one may also
% choose an unsorted order, which means the order is the same as the original
% citations. This corresponds to \texttt{unsrt.bst}. Order of citation is
% also offered for author--year for \texttt{natbib}-type styles that can
% also be used for numerical listings.
%
% Another possibility is to order first by year, then authors. This too only
% makes sense for numerical citations. However, it is offered for author--year
% in the event that a \texttt{natbib}-type style is used for numerical
% listings.
%
% For the alpha style, the ordering is by label only, so no option is
% offered here (|\ifnumerical| is \meta{true} and |\ifmytemp| is \meta{false}).
%
% For author--year, the second choice is by label. (The label is the
% optional |\bibitem| argument, and is what is printed in place of the
% |\cite| command.) With this option, all the papers with the same first
% author are ordered so that the one-author papers come first, followed by
% the two-author papers, followed by the multiple-author papers. This is a
% more sensible system for author--year citations, and is demanded by some
% journals (like JGR).
%
% One problem that can arise here is when two or more references have the
% same set of authors and year; normally they are then ordered by the
% title, ignoring initial words like \textsl{the} and \textsl{a}, with the
% letters a, b,
% c, \dots, added to the year. This can mean that a set of references with
% a natural sequence will be put into a different order. An alternative is
% to order them by the citation keyword instead of by title. This of course
% assumes that the keywords in this case reflect that natural sequence.

% \subsection*{Formatting author names}

% possibilities are to use initials (even if full names in the \texttt{.bib}
% file) either before or after the surnames. A specialty of the journals of
% the American Geophysical Union is to have only the first name with
% reversed initials.
%
% If the reference is part of a larger work with editors, then the editor
% names appear later in the reference text, usually as ``edited by \dots''
% or as ``\emph{names} (editors)''. In these cases, the editor names are
% not usually reversed (surname first) even if the authors' names are.
% An option is provided to format such editor names exactly as the authors'.

%
% Another possibility is that the names be put into a command |\bibnamefont{..}|,
% which must be defined in the \LaTeX\ document. By default, this command does
% not format its argument. There is also a |\bibfnamefont| command for the first

% \subsection*{Names in Citation label}
% This applies to author--year style only. The label is the text written

% `Daly et al.\ (1990b)'. One may select italics for the authors and for the
% extra label attached to the year. The year always remains plain.

% are used in the labels. A user-defined |\citefontname| may also

%
% If a font is selected for the cited authors, then the word `and' may be

%
% It is not possible to select the type of brackets for the year, since

%
% If the author and/or editor is missing, the standard \texttt{.bst} files

% entries.
%
% For author--year styles, the \texttt{key} field is even inserted in the
% reference list and in the label in place of the authors. Optionally, one can
% suppress the year in this case, which causes \texttt{natbib} (version~7)
% to print only that key text as a code designation for the work. Thus if
% \texttt{KEY = "CS1-345"} and there are no authors, then |\citep| produces
% (CS1-345) and |\citet| simply CS1-345. That is, they behave like
% |\citeauthor|. If \texttt{natbib} did not recognize the blank year, one would
% get (CS1-345, ) and CS1-345 (). (Earlier versions of \texttt{natbib} crash on

% \subsection*{Article title in journal}
% The title of an article in a journal or in a collection (a book, or
% conference proceedings) may appear plain, in italics, within single
% or double quotes or even in guillemets. The last is best with T1 coding; a
% poor man's version for OT1 is provided; \LaTeXe\ is required in both cases.
%
% Furthermore, it may have sentence capitalization (first
% word and word following colon) or be capitalized as in the \texttt{.bib} file
% entry. That is why it is recommended to capitalize the entry text as it
% should appear when fully capitalized, putting words that are always
% capitalized in braces. Example:
% \begin{quote}
% |TITLE="The Results of the {Giotto} Mission"|
% \end{quote}
% which produces either ``The results of the Giotto mission'' or ``The
% Results of the Giotto Mission'', depending on option.

% \subsection*{Journal reference}
% Great diversity of opinion exists as to how a journal reference is to be
% formatted. It consists of a volume, possibly a number, and page limits.
% The number is really only necessary if the page numbers within one volume
% start at 1 for each physical `number'. Since journals are often bound
% together in one volume later, it makes more sense to number the pages
% continuously through the whole volume.
%
% I am only aware of one journal that used to reset the pagination for each
% `number', in which case the number was part of the page designation.
% I had erroneously provided an option \texttt{vnum-pg} to achieve this, but I
% now realize that instead, for this one journal, the database entries must
% contain \texttt{pages="(2)33--2(55)"}. This option has been removed at
% version 3.84.
%
% A number of styles for journal specifications are
% \begin{quote}
%   \begin{tabular}{l@{\qquad}l}
% 21(2):33--55             & 21, no.\ 2: 33--55\\
% \textbf{21}(2):33--55    & \textbf{21}, \#2, 33--55\\
% \textit{21}(2), 33--55   & \textit{21} (2); 33--55 \\
% 21(2) (1995) 33--55      & 21(1995), 33-55\\
% 21(2) 33--55             & vol.~21 (2), pp.~33--55
%   \end{tabular}
% \end{quote}
%
% Here both start and stop page numbers have been given; often only the
% start page is wanted.
%
% It is also possible to include the year as part of the journal specification,
% in which case the year is always in parentheses, attached snugly or with space
% to the volume, or preceding the pages.

% \subsection*{Additional Data Fields}\label{sec:revtex}
% \changes{3.89d1}{1999 July 20}{AO: add the revdata option group}
% The American Physical Society's REV\TeX\ package contains \btx\ support
% with a \texttt{bst} file generated from a variant of
% \texttt{\filename}. The extra fields are also available here.
% \begin{itemize}
% \item \textbf{collaboration}: A collaboration name associated with a
% reference.
% \item \textbf{eprint}: The e-print citation for the reference (Los Alamos
% or otherwise). E-print numbers can be turned into hyperlinks to the
% online article. The output is\\
%    \hspace*{2em}|\eprint{|\textit{eprint-spec}|}|
% \item \textbf{archive}: is an optional argument for |\eprint|, as\\
%    \hspace*{2em}|\eprint[|\textit{archive-des}|]{|\textit{eprint-spec}|}|\\
% The \textit{archive-des} is some code such as \texttt{arXiv} that is
% translated to a base URL by a class or package file. The default definition
% of |\eprint| ignores \textit{archive-des} and prints \textit{eprint-spec}
% as a URL.
% \item \textbf{url}: A URL associated with the reference. Can be turned
% into a hyperlink.
% \end{itemize}
%
% A collaboration appears as part of the author list and the other two
% appear at the end of the citaton. The URL field can be selected
% independently of this option.
%
% In addition there are new fields for journals like Phys.\ Rev.~D that
% no longer use page numbers.
% \begin{itemize}
% \item \textbf{eid}: Electronic article identifier.
% \item \textbf{numpages}: Number of pages in an article. For use in
% conjunction with the \textbf{eid} field when page counts are
% desired. Deprecated when submitting to Phys.\ Rev.
%
% The \texttt{eprint} (with \texttt{archive}) and \texttt{url} fields may be
% included independently of the other REV\TeX\ fields.
%
% The \texttt{eid} field is now always included, although it is optional for
% the bibliography entries. This electronic identifier is a replacement for the
% page number in electronic journals: it is the sequence number in the printed
% volume. If present, it will be used in place of the page number.
%
% \end{itemize}

% For electronic documents with an Internet address, add a URL entry.
% Harvard already has this, but here it is done for all styles.
% The URL text will be set with the \verb!\url! command in the \texttt{url}
% package by Donald Arseneau. This package must be loaded for the command
% to work right. It allows line breaks at punctuations. Otherwise,
% \verb!\texttt! is used instead, with no line breaks. The URL text is preceded
% by \verb!\urlprefix! which defaults to ``URL '' but may be redefined by the
% user to be whatever s/he wants. The final space must be included.
%
% Note: selecting the REV\TeX\ fields automatically includes this, so the
% offer only is made if REV\TeX\ has been rejected.

% \subsection*{Reference Component Tagging}
% \changes{3.89d1}{1999 July 20}{AO: add the bibinfo option group}
% If reference component tagging is enabled, we
% apply tags like |\bibinfo| and |\eprint| to the fields of data
% in the content of the |\bibitem| statement. We also ensure that
% these commands have a default meaning within the scope of the |thebibliography|
% environment. The default definitions simply print the field and ignore the
% tag. However, other programs or packages might make use of the tag
% information to separate authors from title, for example.
%
%    \begin{macrocode}
\beginoptiongroup{REFERENCE COMPONENT TAGS:}{}
\optdef{*}{}{No reference component tags}
 {in the \string\bibitem\space entries}
\optdef{b}{bibinfo}{Reference component tags}

\getans
\endoptiongroup
%    \end{macrocode}
%
% \subsection*{Define emphasis}
% In everything that been mentioned so far, italicization should be
% understood to mean `emphasize' in the \LaTeX{} sense. This means that the
% command |\em| is used. This is not the same as |\it|, which is always
% italics. Rather, with |\em|, the font style switches between |\rm| and
% |\it| depending on the context. Here one may choose to true italics, or
% to switch off italics altogether.
%    \begin{macrocode}
\beginoptiongroup{EMPHASIS:
 (affects all so-called italics)}{}
\optdef{*}{}{Use emphasis}{ie, \string\em, allows font switching}
\optdef{i}{em-it}{Use true italics}{ie, \string\it, absolute italics}

\optdef{u}{em-ul}{Underlining}{in place of italics, best with ulem package}
\getans
\endoptiongroup
%    \end{macrocode}
%
% \subsection*{Plain \TeX\ compatibility}
% Bold face, italics, and emphasis are made with the \LaTeXe\ commands,
% which makes them incompatible with the obsolete \LaTeX2.09, and with
% Plain \TeX. There are also some extra testing for existing commands
% that best work with \LaTeXe\ syntax.
%
% If the bibliography style file is to be fully compatible with Plain \TeX,
% do not select the option \texttt{nfss} but do take \texttt{plntx}.
%    \begin{macrocode}

% The \texttt{harvard} package now (version 2.0.3, for \LaTeXe) uses
% |\harvardand| in place of the word \textsl{and} so that it can be changed
% at run time. This is allowed for with the option \texttt{harnm}, which
% need not be used only with the \texttt{har} option.
% This seems like a useless feature for \texttt{.bst} files made from
% this multilanguage source. However, it is included anyway, which means
% if \texttt{harnm} option selected, one must redefine |\harvardand|
% in the document for the language being used.
%
% The location of the junior part for reversed name is not obvious. Prior
% to version 4.0, I always had it attached to the last name, as
% Smith, Jr, John, put it probably is better as Smith, John, Jr. For the
% AGU \texttt{nm-rev1} I always did it this way, probably because I had a
% good AGU example to follow. Dilemma: do I just change them all or add an
% option to do it? The option will maintain consistency with older
% versions, but this could also be considered a bug fix rather than a new
% feature. Solution: use the option, since I have found other \texttt{.bst}
% files from Beebe and Harvard that put junior between surname and first
% name.

% \changes{3.89d1}{1999 July 20}{AO: encapsulate editor for later processing;
%    trap empty editor list}
% When editors are used in place of authors to identify the work, the
% names are always formatted just like authors'. However, in collections,
% where ``edited by'' or ``\emph{names} (editors)'' are given, it is
% normal not to reverse the names, even if the authors' are. The option
% \texttt{ed-rev} sees to it that editor names are always formatted exactly
% like those of authors, being reversed if necessary.
%
% The option \texttt{ed-au} is identical to \texttt{ed-rev}, but is more
% logical. It means editors (in incollections) are formatted exactly like
% authors, with all the font, reversing, and number limitations. This is
% selected automatically with \texttt{nm-init} and \texttt{nm-} default to save
% programming memory.
%
% The option \texttt{nm-revf} in this case acts the same as the default
% when no \texttt{nm-} option given: full names with surname last. Therefore
% it is not necessary to test for it at all, since it, like the default,
% has the lowest priority: any other \texttt{nm-} option clobbers it.
%
% The options \texttt{aunm-semi} and \texttt{aunm-sl} will put a semi-colon or
% slash between editor names, just as for authors, when \texttt{ed-rev} not
% selected, in keeping with the idea that in this case both authors and editors
% are to be formatted the same.
%
% This function either dispatches to \texttt{format.names} or executes code
% which is similar. In the latter case, names are always presented first
% followed by surname (``last name''); name limit processing (\texttt{nmlm}) is not executed;
% and endgame processing differs in being qualified by \texttt{nmfted}.
%
% Stack note: if the names (second) argument is a non-nil list, this function returns
% with one object on the stack, the formatted list of names.

% on. The field is reduced to lower case to make it case insensitive. If no
% translation is found, then the original text in \texttt{edition} is used

% the maximum for which text is provided, then \texttt{bbl.th} is added to

% Prior to version 3.81, the \textsl{Editor} or \textsl{Edited by} in
% parentheses was meant to be capitalized, but this did not work properly.
% Now the option \texttt{edcap} produces this, and default is not capitalized.
%
% Notes on \dtx{} options:
% \begin{itemize}
% \item
% The following combinations are available through the \texttt{makebst.tex} interface:
% \begin{verbatim}
% (
%  <default>
%  |edby     (      |edbyx       |edbyy|edbyw[edcap])
%  |edby-par (|edcap|edbyx[edcap]|edbyy             )
%  |edby-parc(|edcap|edbyx                          )
% )
% \end{verbatim}
% \item
% \texttt{edby}, \texttt{edby-par}, and \texttt{edby-parc} are mutually exclusive
% and, except for the default, exhaustive.
% \item
% \texttt{edbyx}, \texttt{edbyw}, and \texttt{edbyy} are mutually exclusive
% and, except for the default, exhaustive.
% \item
% \texttt{edcap} is independent of the above two groups of options.
% \item
% When parentheses need to be applied, we make sure that the respective
% \dtx{} guard expressions are mutually exclusive.
% It makes no sense for \texttt{edbyw} to be in effect if either of
% \texttt{edby-par} or \texttt{edby-parc} is in effect.
% \item
% \texttt{makebst.tex} only activates \texttt{edcap} in certain cases,
% but we do no checking here, applying it consistently to the
% ``editor'' text entity.
% \item
% The code between \texttt{<!edpar>} and \verb+<edpar\|edparc>+
% \emph{must} match the corresponding code in \texttt{format.editors}.
% This means that in the default case, formatting is controlled by
% a \dtx{} mechanism entirely different from the other cases.
% \item \texttt{ser-ed} has been added to suit AGU. Result of series plus
% volume to go between booktitle and editors; must remove \texttt{format.bvolume}
% from \texttt{incollection} and \texttt{inproceedings}.

% \changes{3.3}{1995 Aug 7}{Put extra label in braces}
% The extra label is added in braces so that natbib can treat it as one unit.
% This allows extra labels to be more than one letter long. For non-NFSS
% emphasizing, this is no problem, since labels go in |{\em a}|, but for
% non-emphasizing and for NFSS, it caused troubles without the braces.
% The trouble arises with multiple citations in one |\cite| in which
% authors and years are the same, and only the extra label is given for
% the next one. Note: |\emph{a}| is more than one letter long in this sense,
% so it is not just a problem for more than 26 papers with same authors and
% year.
%
% \changes{3.81}{1996 Jun 17}{Add \texttt{\char`\\natexlab}}
% The command |\natexlab| now encloses the extra label for \texttt{natbib}
% styles. This command normally just prints its argument, but for numerical
% citation mode, it swallows its argument. This allows the extra labels to
% be suppressed for numerical citations where they are superfluous.
% The enclosing braces mentioned above must be included here to make the
% entire extra label text a single token for \texttt{natbib}.
